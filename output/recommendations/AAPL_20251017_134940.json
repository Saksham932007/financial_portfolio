  "reasoning": "AAPL is in a moderate uptrend with its current price above key 50-period moving averages (SMA_50, EMA_50), which is a generally bullish sign. However, several factors suggest caution for an immediate directional trade. The MACD indicates bearish momentum (MACD line below signal line), and the price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a recent pullback or consolidation phase. The RSI is neutral, providing no strong directional signal. Sentiment analysis is also neutral. Crucially, the calculated Risk/Reward Ratio of 1.19 does not meet the specified criterion of >1.5 for a strong BUY recommendation. While the underlying trend remains positive, the mixed short-term technical signals, neutral sentiment, and a suboptimal risk/reward profile warrant a HOLD position, awaiting clearer bullish confirmation or a more favorable entry point.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Risk/Reward Ratio (1.19) is below the BUY threshold of >1.5",
    "MACD shows short-term bearish momentum",
    "Neutral sentiment provides no additional conviction",
    "Price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a recent pullback/consolidation",
    "Overall trend remains a moderate uptrend, with price above 50-period moving averages"

  "timeframe": "short_term",
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "entry_strategy": "Await clearer bullish technical confirmation, such as a MACD bullish crossover, price breaking decisively above the middle Bollinger Band, or a retest of support (e.g., $244.0) with strong rebound conviction, alongside an improved risk/reward setup.",
  "exit_strategy": "For existing holders, maintain position unless price breaks below strong support at $244.0 or the specified stop loss of $241.56. For potential buyers, delay entry.",
  "warnings": [
    "The current pullback indicated by price near the lower Bollinger Band could deepen.",
    "Bearish MACD momentum suggests continued short-term downward pressure.",
    "Lack of strong bullish sentiment."
